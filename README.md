# About
This extension adds two panels to pixelorama. One to display a selected frame and one to display an animation. When selecting a frame, the corresponding sections of the sprite sheet will be selected.

# Installation
To use the extension, drag the .pck file into Pixelorama. Then go to Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions and select and enable FFTorama.
Two new tabs should appear in the top left. They can be dragged to new locations within pixelorama.
