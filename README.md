# About
This extension adds three panels to pixelorama:  
1) Displays a selected frame  
2) Displays a selected animation  
3) Shows settings for the extension  

When selecting a frame, the corresponding sections of the sprite sheet will be selected.

# Installation
To use the extension, drag the .pck file into Pixelorama. Then go to Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions and select and enable FFTorama.
Three new tabs should appear in the top left. They can be dragged to new locations within pixelorama.
